# Adventure Game

A first attempt at building something with Unreal Engine. So far just the most basic functionality, implemented in C++ rather than blueprints.

## Sources
~~Based on the [*Game Animation Sample*](https://www.fab.com/listings/880e319a-a59e-4ed2-b268-b32dac7fa016) project from Epic Games.~~
Redid the project from start to not have so many dependencies and "blueprinted" parts. As much as possible will be done through C++.

Used the [*Code a First-Person Adventure Game*](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/code-a-firstperson-adventure-game-in-unreal-engine) tutorial to start implementing basic functionality.

The above tutorial has plenty of issues, so the [*forums*](https://forums.unrealengine.com/categories?tag=unreal-engine) were very helpful.

Used the [*Play Audio in C++ for Unreal Engine in 4 Minutes!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsAPj4IDN0Y) video for adding sounds.

Used the [*Building an RPG in Unreal Engine 5*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB-SEOucjpoNelORi7b0phlF4yfnU7bSX) tutorial to start implementing basic functionality.

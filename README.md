# Adventure Game

A first attempt at building something with Unreal Engine. So far just the most basic functionality, implemented in C++ rather than blueprints.

## Sources
Based on the [Game Animation Sample](https://www.fab.com/listings/880e319a-a59e-4ed2-b268-b32dac7fa016) project from Epic Games.

Used the [Code a First-Person Adventure Game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/code-a-firstperson-adventure-game-in-unreal-engine) tutorial to start implementing basic functionality.

The above tutorial has plenty of issues, so the [forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/categories?tag=unreal-engine) were very helpful.

Used the [Play Audio in C++ for Unreal Engine in 4 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsAPj4IDN0Y) video for adding sounds.
